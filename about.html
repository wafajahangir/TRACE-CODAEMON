         <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Trace was founded with a simple yet powerful idea: what if donors could see exactly where their money goes and what impact it creates? What if NGOs could prove their effectiveness and build trust through transparent reporting?</p>

          <p>We built a platform that connects NGOs and donors through a unique point-based ranking system. NGOs earn points by documenting their work, submitting proof of impact, and demonstrating effective use of donations. This creates a competitive yet collaborative environment that drives excellence in the nonprofit sector.</p>

          <p>Today, Trace serves hundreds of NGOs and thousands of donors, facilitating millions in transparent donations and creating real, measurable impact in communities around the world.</p>
